# commelim README

This extension have a function only remove comment line start with "//" in main.dt and "#" in pubspec.yaml Flutter autogenerated. 

Please, do command at main.dart or pubspec.yaml.
For other text file, this maybe excute correctly too, but I don't test.
And I tested only Windows.

## Known Issues

In pubspec.yaml, Some behavior is strange. (Position of "version:" after execution.)
